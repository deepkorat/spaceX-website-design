Initially, when I was fully a novice in Application Development, I started to learn HTML and CSS and I tried to explore Toy projects from Youtube.
You can see One of them through this GitHub page link. <a href="https://deepkorat.github.io/spaceX-website-design">SpaceX</a>

In this Spacex Redesign website, I learned CSS properties as well as how JavaScript works with HTML and CSS.
